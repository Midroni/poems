    - was my favorite to see.
        - was my favorite to see. The warm light against such an atmospheric cold.

    - On that runway, I wanted
- to run away.
    - to run away very badly.

                    - tender like that, with each other. Knowing the dusk and not the chokehold.

- rolling.
